        <h1> City Girl </h1>
        <p> new years eve. pours talk of promise rings and kansas city. </p>
        <p> but youâ€™re a city girl, say the friends. </p>
        <p> girl says, </p>
        <p> kansas city is a city, to the </p>
        <p> promise. rings of kansas city. of </p>
        <p> nowhere (in your eyes) </p>
        <p> are blessings in disguise when you </p>
        <p> don't think about it.</p>
        <p> The friends think, her fault, falling for a republican,</p>
        <p> say: well don't get bent out of shape </p>
        <p> as boy walks (in. his eyes) </p>
        <p> the room glimmers haunt. </p>
        <p> i know. he knows i know. she said no, </p>
        <p> thinks girl. </p>
        <p> the room is ringing. </p>
        <p> but no point in caring what girl thinks. </p>
        <p> girl's been giving cold shoulder</p>
        <p> in an upstairs frat bed </p>
        <p> the past three years. at midnight </p>
        <p> toasts of empty promise </p>
        <p> me, the girl. With no proof. And no, (in your </p>
        <p> eyes) means promise. Ringing </p>
        <p> in the new year </p>
        <p> girl hopes he gets a taste </p>
         <p> of his own skin. </p>
