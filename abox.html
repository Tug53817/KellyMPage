    <h1> A Box Labeled: BOX </h1>
    
    <p> There was a manhunt for a serial assaulter in South Philadelphia. He attacked </p>
    <p> nine women, on both sides of Broad, biking around night and day, rounding street corners, past our homes, peering about, I bet, for prey. </p>
    <p> I watched the reports obsessively. Because two occurred along my running route. Because I’m an assault survivor.</p>
    <p> Because the word “serial” makes ears perk. Makes news. Makes a tragedy a Netflix trend. Makes a million. </p>
    <p> “Serial” means repeated behavioral patterns. </p>
    <p> To repeatedly intrude a home, a body, and leave unscathed leads an intruder to believe the past is behind them. But memories cannot be boxed. </p>
    <p> In the time a therapist calls my “pre-trauma life” I was in love with a boy, stationed states away. We wrote letters now stored under my bed in a box labeled: BOX </p>
    <p> OF BOYFRIENDS PAST. His are its only artifacts. A shrine I don’t often honor. </p>
    <p> It’s not that I resent public media. It’s that my home is too loud. My home is invaded by satellite. </p>
    <p> On visits we kept a journal: On Hollywood Boulevard I got a stomach ache. In June he said he’d missed me. Then backed into a parked car in Little Tokyo. I remember </p>
    <p> the thump. of trains heading west on Regional Rail. in the days we dreamed of living in “the city.” </p>
    <p> “the” city meaning Philadelphia. “The” is commonly used to refer to a place or thing that is unique. </p>
    <p> For example, the city I dreamed of and the Philadelphia I live in are not the same cities. </p>
    <p> The past still does not taste as the future promised. </p>
